I attended a 3D printing workshop to learn more about how the process works. 3D printing is rapidly advancing, what interests me more is how it is able to be used in the medical field. My final presentation is specifically on this topic, so I am glad that I was able to see the ongoing process as well as the final products (although UNC does not have the technology to bioprint and make products out of tissue).  

The workshop was an introduction course so it started from the very basics.  In order to create a 3D printed object you first have to have a blueprint. There are a couple of way to make a blueprint; you can find an finished blueprint online, you can scan an object with a scanner to get the dimensions, or you can make your own blueprint. At the workshop I was shown a list of websites that allow you to create your own blueprint, they range in difficulty level, but are all effective. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com) is a website that is most commonly used, it is very user friendly.  

There were various different types of 3D printed objects that are displayed in the makerspace.  There was a prosthetic hand that a group of students make for children that need them, it was prety neat.  There was also a really cute elephant that looked like this ![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSl9deEjY0vg7JMvl0j745tLQWXGxANMYSl7y_PI0ddhcVEmcDryQ)
