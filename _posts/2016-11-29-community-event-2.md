I attended a 3D printing workshop to learn more about how the process works. 3D printing is rapidly advancing, what interests me more is how it is able to be used in the medical field. My final presentation is specifically on this topic, so I am glad that I was able to see the ongoing process as well as the final products (although UNC does not have the technology to bioprint and make products out of tissue).  

The workshop was an introduction course so it started from the very basics.  In order to create a 3D printed object you first have to have a blueprint. There are a couple of way to make a blueprint; you can find an finished blueprint online, you can scan an object with a scanner to get the dimensions, or you can make your own blueprint. At the workshop I was shown a list of websites that allow you to create your own blueprint, they range in difficulty level, but are all effective. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com) is a website that is most commonly used, it is very user friendly.  

There were various different types of 3D printed objects that are displayed in the makerspace.  There was a prosthetic hand that a group of students make for children that need them, it was prety neat.  There was also a really cute elephant that looked like this:

There was another elephant that was incomplete, the top was missing, but it serves to show how the interior looks. You would expect the inside to be solid, but it is actually hollow.  It has a honeycomb pattern that serves as a support base, but the hollowness allows the item not to be dense, and it also uses less material.  When I think of 3D printing I usually think that the items products are made of plastic, and if it is bio-printing then they are made out of bio-material, so I was really surprised when they mentioned all the different material that could be used such as platinum, steel, silver, gold, etc. It is not actually surprising in the way that I didn't think it could be possible, but I just never really thought about it, I mean who can afford a 3D printed item made out of gold?  

UNC not only 3D printing workshops, and the necessary equipment to make item, but they also allow UNC students and affiliates to print 3D items for free!!! If you would like to print out a 3D item all you have to do is submit a request [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScfWHSCBVDBoW5cc4iUqbcAqyu-GCS1sGZzdG3J4QtRXMuu-g/viewform).  You will need to make your own design or find a blueprint online and you also have a consultation with the experts and they will recoment which material will best work for the item you would like printed and answer any other questions/concerns you may have.  

***I am planning on linking my assignment 6 presentation to this post once it is complete since it is related and the presentation is informative and shows how 3D printing is used in the medical field***
