I attended an event hosted by Women in Computer Science where I learned the basics of coding.
We started off by going to a website, scratch.mit.edu.  At first glance the page looks like it is meant for little kids because it is very colorful and has lots of cartoon animations, but it is very educational and makes learning how to code more fun.
The website portrays coding like a puzzle, which in reality it is somewhat like a puzzle becasue all of the "pieces" have to fit in order for the program to function properly.
To start off you have to pick a "sprite", or a character, there is a variety of random sprite to choose from.  You are able to edit the sprite's size, I think you can even create and upload your on sprite (but that's too advanced for me at the moment).
Next, you choose the setting by choosing a background.  Then you can start coding by animating your sprite with motions, such as "turn 30 degrees" or "go to mouse-pointer". 
You can combine other scripts along with motion, like sound, control, events, and more to make the sprite more interactive and create a game out of it; it could get a little confusing when you add a lot of scripts because you could get confused with which script does what, but the website color coded each category, like motion is blue, events are orange, ect., which makes it easier. 
There are endless numbers of games that can be created on the site; during the event we were able to create a game.
The website also has lots of tips, how-to videos, and step-by-step instructions to get you started with coding.



After playing around on scratch for a little bit we went on to a more challenging form of coding.  I do not recall the website's name, but it basically had a lot of math problems;
instead of solving the problems by paper, we created a code to solve it for us.  This was a bit more technical since you needed a bit of coding experience, so we walked through it together. 
We used compilejava.net to create the code instead of downloading a program. 



I really enjoyed the program because it was open to all majors, meaning that no experience in coding was needed, and anyone could learn coding if they want to.
scratch.mit.edu is a wonderful website becasue it is simple enough for a beginner to use, but at the same time you could still challenge yourself by experimenting new things.
One of my little sisters is interested in coding so I was able to share the website with her.
