Assignment 4 was scripting again, it seemed pretty simple.  As a group, Emma, Dylan, and I came up with the questions for the survey. 
Dylan was the most experience with scripting so he took the lead and help us when we got stuck, and he created the script.  We were able to work together, eaching taking turns to make sure we did not interfere with each other. 
We got used to using `git pull` after another user `git push`-ed while we were creating the .csv with all of our data. After the script was created I was the first to run it, mainly becasue it was the day the President
was on campus and I was the only person from my group in class at the moment. The script worked fine, but of course, like always, I had to mess something up because what's an assignment if I don't screw it up first?
Somehow I merged it somewhere or something, I'm not exactly sure what happened, but luckily Dylan was there to help me fix it.

I was expecting working in a group to be tougher than it was.  My group worked well together, everyone did the work they were supposed to in a timely manner 
despite the difficulties encountered with Cloud9 and Obama coming to campus.
