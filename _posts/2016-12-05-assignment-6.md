Malvika and I decided to present on a topic that combines medicine and technology.  3D printing is a neat technology within itself, and the way it is used in medicine is just amazing, we wanted to learn more and share it with others as well. 

I cloned and created the new repo that would hold the presentation, then Malvika was able to pull and gain access to the repo.  Since we cloned the wrong instructions I then had to change the origin branch from master to gh-pages.  

Malvika and I both did research on the topic and placed our findings in a google doc to help organize the our thoughts and decide what we wanted to include. After deciding that, we created the slides and added comments in the script to remind us what was going on the slides and what we were going to say. We both added information and images on the slides.  I added the speaker's notes, but it was basically the script we both worte.

We recoded the audio for the presentation in the SILS digital media room.  The script was written between the both of us, and we alternated who spoke on each slide. I saved the audio files on a USB and then uploaded them on to github. Malvika uploaded the audio to the individual slides. 

Since our presentation is on 3D printing and UNC has some 3D printers that are available to UNC students we thought it would be cool to have a video showing the process.  Malvika booked the appointment and found the blueprint of the item that was to be printed. We both showed up to the printing. It was recorded using Malvika's phone and she edited the video to show the sped up process.  

While creating the presentation, it took us a while to figure out how to view it.  We figured out how to buil dit by renaming the file.  We also ran into a lot of problems with the audio and video. The audio would not work since it was not named following the example.  The original audio was also still playing in the background even though the command was removed from the file. Once the audio files were renamed to follow the example that problem was fixed.  The video gave us problems becasue at first it was too long to be pushed onto github, the quality was downsized and the video was small enough to `push`. We also tried lazy loading in order for the video to begin when the audio for the slide begins, but when we wrote the command for that it pervented all of our slides from loading. Then we removed the lazy loading command and got the presentation working, but then tried to create the video into a loop in order for it to continuously run throughout the presentation and not be over by the time we got to that slide. Everything was finally fixed and worked perfectly. Malvika made the background and styling changed in HTML. 

This assignment required HTML and markdown skills. I felt more comfortable with markdown than with HTML. I was able to ask Malvika for help whenever I got stuck. This assignment required quite a bit of research whenever we got stuck. I might be asked to use these skills at work if needed, but I do not think I will use them on my own,  I do not feel confident enough to use then, but I know that confidence comes along with lots of practice. I have not thought about taking more INLS courses, but I might change my mid, this course was a bit challenging fr me, but at the same time it i got an awesome feeling when I was able to get something to work.
