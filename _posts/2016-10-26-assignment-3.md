The original document is from my Portguese class.  We watched a movie, "Only When I Dance" and the questions answered were to help guide us for the written assignment.
The movie documented the lives of two Brazilian ballet dancers who were of low income and were unable to achieve their dreams alone and needed to compete in various competitions in order to recieve scholarships.
The movie showed the hardships they and their families go through and how rewarding the experience is.


In order to get the documents to convert, I first had to make an original document in markdown, after that, the command `pandoc -o example.html example.md` converted the markdown version to an HTLM version.
I simply repeated the command, slightly altering it, depending on the type of format I desired.  
All documents are able to be converted with one simple click by using scripting.  I also used "echo" when scripting to let the user know that the conversions were complete. 


The document conversions can be found on [github](https://github.com/inls161/assignment-3-jpueb96)

Scripting the commands was somewhat easy since we went over it in class and I was able to look back at the notes. Creating the markdown effects like **bold** and *italics* and making list was fun, I like how the it changes colors.  
I was stuggling with inserting the image and the table (because I was using HTML :sweat_smile:), but once I used markdown I had no problems.  
I also tried to use `&&` when using `pandoc` to save time, but it did not work for some reason so I just left it as it is now.
