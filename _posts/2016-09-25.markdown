This is my first post! Class has gone better, I get the hang of it once I practice it A LOT.  I am hoping to become quicker at catching on as the class progresses. 
I feel like I am getting better at commiting and pushing.  I know how to get jekyll running, I've been working on styling my page; I have made most of it to me liking, except I connot figure out how to change the color of one section.

Let's see what I learn this week in class!
