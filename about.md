I like to say that I am a tarheel born and bred becasue I was born at UNC Hospital, even if I have lived in Durham all of my life.
My family is composed of both of my parents and three sisters (no brothers). My parents are originally from Mexico, making me Mexican-American.  I speak English, hablo español, e falo português.
